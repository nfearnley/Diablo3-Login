Diablo3-Login
=============

Summary
-------

This is a Diablo 3 login helper, useful when you keep getting Error 37 messages.

Requirements
------------

You need autohotkey installed to use this script

Instructions
------------

1. Run the script, and it will ask you for your password

2. Enter your password

3. Open Diablo 3

4. Attempt to login normally

5. When prompted with an error message, press backslash (usually above your enter key)

6. The script will close the login, reenter your password, and reattempt the login

Security
--------

Your password is only remembered as long as the script is open. If you want it to forget your password, just close the autohotkey icon in the System Tray.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This script is meant to run at full screen. Fullscreen windowed mode should work, normal windowed mode will probably not work.

This was tested on a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor. It should work properly at other resolutions, although it may have problems with really weird screen sizes.
